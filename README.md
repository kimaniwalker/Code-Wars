# Code Wars Challenges

### Purpose
Hello coders, recruiters, and fellow developers. Thank you for taking the time to visit my repo. I am starting this repo as a way to challenge myself and become a better developer. I will be updating this repo daily with new challenges and my solutions to the problem. The primary focus here will be mastering JS as it is the most popular programming language in the world. 


#### Day 1 -  [Stop gninnipS My sdroW!](./Day1-Stop-gninnipS-My-sdroW!/main.js)

**Description:**
Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (like the name of this kata).

Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces.
Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

**Examples:**

```
spinWords("Hey fellow warriors") => "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
spinWords("This is a test") => "This is a test" 
spinWords("This is another test") => "This is rehtona test"

```

#### Day 2 -  [List Filtering](./Day2-List-Filtering/main.js)

**Description**
In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

**Examples**
```
filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]
filter_list([1,'a','b',0,15]) == [1,0,15]
filter_list([1,2,'aasf','1','123',123]) == [1,2,123]

```
